    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger
      and Anton Piëch in 1931. The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the
      company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One
      of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people;
      that is, a Volkswagen. This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.

  <div id="Development">
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the
      Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several parts
      used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and
      most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started
      utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who
      also had designed the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured
      air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing
      automobiles that are very well balanced.</p>
